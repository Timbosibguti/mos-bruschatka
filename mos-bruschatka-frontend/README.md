# mos-bruschatka.ru

## Development

If you have docker installed, just run `docker-compose up`. 

This will launch the container in which the node has already installed
 and will automatically execute in it `npm install && npm run watch`.
 
Note that repository mos-brushatka-ru must be cloned to the directory above this (i.e. accessible from here by path `../mos-brushatka-ru`).
